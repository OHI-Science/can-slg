Narwhal harvesting will be closed by notice issued by a Fishery Officer.

In Nunavut, the Regional Wildlife Organization (RWO) allocates the TALC to the associated Hunters and Trappers Organizations (HTOs).

Each management category has specific management actions to ensure sustainability and/or the recovery of a stock. The following are each management category with it's associated management actions that play into Dolly Varden's strategy to control exploitation. 

Healthy: 5% removal rate, based on the most recent stock size estimate; Voluntary harvest management; Only general legislative requirements and sport fishing limits apply.

Cautious: Less than 5% removal rate, based on the most recent stock size estimate; Promote rebuilding of the stock through education and specific management measure; Voluntary harvest management; Only general legislative requirements and sport fishing limits apply; Maintain regular stock assessments to determine population status and trend.

Critical: No targeted harvest; Harvest closure in regulations; Promote rebuilding of the stock through education and specific management measures; Maintain regular stock assessments to determine population status and trends.

Undetermined: Maintain regular stock assessments to determine population status and trend; Less than 5% removal rate; Promote rebuilding of the stock if required through education and specific management measures; Voluntary harvest management; Only general legislative requirements and sport fishing limits apply.

Due to the mortalities of NARWs, DFO announced on July 10, 2017 that it was implementing an immediate mitigation measure to minimize the risks to the species which is listed as endangered under the Species at Risk Act (SARA). A temporary closure to snow crab fishing activity was in effect from 16:00 (ADT) on July 14, 2017 to 23:59 ADT on July 28, 2017 in an area where a concentration of NARWs has been observed. The temporary closed area supported the Department’s commitment to help prevent future incidents with the species during the remainder of the snow crab fishery. DFO also announced that more closures could be implemented if deemed necessary. Licence holders were also asked to report all observations of dead or injured marine mammals by calling a 1-866-567-6277 and to refrain from attempting to untangle any whales.

On July 20, 2018, DFO announced that it was closing the snow crab fishery earlier due to more recent incidents with North Atlantic Right Whales (NARW) in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The fishery closed on July 25, 2017 at 00:01 Atlantic Daylight Time (ADT).

Keep fishing mortality moderate by using the following references and risk tolerances:

•	The TAC may be set with a neutral (50%) probability of exceeding the fishing mortality target reference (FREF) when it is above the upper stock reference (USR).

•	The TAC may be set with a low (less than 25%) probability of exceeding the fishing mortality limit reference (FLIM) when the spawning stock biomass (SSB) is above BMSY/ the USR.

•	The TAC should be set to mitigate declines and, when possible, promote positive change in SSB over a three-year period when it is below the upper stock reference (USR).  A harvest strategy of FREF is acceptable when the stock is in the Cautious Zone, so long as the first criterion is met; however, it is required that fishing mortality will decline as the stock progresses lower into the Cautious Zone.  The management response will vary depending on location of the stock within the Cautious Zone, whether the stock is increasing or decreasing, whether the trajectory (growth or decline) is projected to continue, and indications of incoming recruitment to the SSB, for example.
 
•	When the SSB is below the limit reference point (LRP), the harvest strategy is to be results-driven rather than based on a predetermined harvest rate.  Rebuilding to a level above the LRP should be achieved in a reasonable timeframe (1.5 to 2 generations) with a high degree of probability (greater than 75%).

Keep fishing mortality moderate by using the following references and risk tolerances:

• The TAC may be set with a neutral (50%) probability of exceeding the fishing mortality target reference (FREF) when it is above the upper stock reference (USR).

• The TAC may be set with a low (less than 25%) probability of exceeding the fishing mortality limit reference (FLIM) when the spawning stock biomass (SSB) is above BMSY/ the USR.

• The TAC should be set to mitigate declines and, when possible, promote positive change in SSB over a three-year period when it is below the upper stock reference (USR).  A harvest strategy of FREF is acceptable when the stock is in the Cautious Zone, so long as the first criterion is met; however, it is required that fishing mortality will decline as the stock progresses lower into the Cautious Zone.  The management response will vary depending on location of the stock within the Cautious Zone, whether the stock is increasing or decreasing, whether the trajectory (growth or decline) is projected to continue, and indications of incoming recruitment to the SSB, for example.
 
When the SSB is below the limit reference point (LRP), the harvest strategy is to be results-driven rather than based on a predetermined harvest rate.  Rebuilding to a level above the LRP should be achieved in a reasonable timeframe (1.5 to 2 generations) with a high degree of probability (greater than 75%).  The TAC (if appropriate) should be set with a very low (less than 5%) risk of biomass decline.

Transboundary Resource Assessment Committee (TRAC) process:
In 2002 TMGC adopted a strategy to maintain a low to neutral risk of exceeding the fishing mortality limit reference, Fref = 0.25, for yellowtail. In addition, when stock conditions are poor the TMGC strategy is to further reduce fishing mortality rates to promote rebuilding.

This measure is in place for fisheries for groundfish.

In 2017 the fishery did not have any bycatch mitigation or management measures in place for White shark.","5Z Yellowtail Flounder may be caught as bycatch only in the 5Z groundfish fishery, with bycatch limits in place to prevent directed fishing.

Yellowtail flounder is part of a multi-species groundfish fishery that interacts with a number of retained and non-retained bycatch species. While measures are in place to manage bycatch, these measures have not been evaluated for all species.

The following provisional rules are to be used when setting TACs. 

When SSB is Above the Upper Stock Reference (USR) (i.e. in the Healthy Zone):
•	Measures should generally promote the SSB remaining above the USR. 
•	The base target exploitation rate will be 15% of exploitable biomass. This rate can increase gradually, particularly as an artifact of a stable TAC strategy applied during a time of declining SSB while in this zone, subject to monitoring/signals that excessive fishing mortality is being exerted on the stock. 
•	The exploitation rate should not exceed FMSY, a level that is yet to be calculated, but is thought to be well above the base target exploitation rate. Changes in the TAC should generally not exceed 15% of the previous TAC, unless the stock is declining precipitously. 
•	Government should not facilitate any increase in industry capacity/infrastructure during any period. 

When SSB is between the Limit Reference Point (LRP) and the Upper Stock Reference (USR) (i.e. in the Cautious Zone):
•	Measures should generally promote the SSB rebuilding towards the USR, subject to natural fluctuations that may be expected to occur in biomass and survey results. 
•	If SSB is in the upper half of the Cautious Zone, the exploitation rate should not exceed 2/3 FMSY, thought to be significantly above 15% of exploitable biomass
•	If SSB is in the second lowest quadrant of the Cautious Zone, the exploitation rate should not exceed 1/2 FMSY, thought to be above 15% of exploitable biomass
•	If SSB is in the lowest quadrant of the Cautious Zone, the exploitation rate should not exceed 15% of exploitable biomass
•	The TAC should not be increased if the SSB is projected to decline or is within a declining trend
•	Changes in the TAC should generally not exceed 15% of the previous TAC, unless the stock is declining precipitously.

When SSB is Below the Limit Reference Point (LRP): 
•	Measures must explicitly promote an increase in the biomass above the LRP within 6 years of falling below the LRP. 
•	Any fishing mortality must be in the context of a rebuilding plan, and should not exceed 10%.",Harvest rate/level at or below removal reference,,,,No,,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Yes,Partially,Yes,,Partially,Yes,Yes,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,IFMP has been updated and will be posted in the summer,,,

Size: male crabs are sexually mature for 1-2 years before recruiting into the fishery. Sex: retention of female crabs is only permitted in FSC fisheries. Season: many of the Crab Management Areas observe a seasonal closure to protect recently moulted legal male crabs. In a recent study, Zhang and Dunham (2013) developed reference points for Crab Management Area I and found that from 1988 to 2010, despite high exploitation rates (> 90% for legal male crabs; Zhang et al., 2002) the stock was generally in the healthy zone. Cyclic fluctuations are observed in Dungeness crab stocks, and subsequently catch, coast wide. Although biotic factors can influence populations, oceanographic conditions are thought to have the greatest influence on recruitment and in turn have been found to be the best predictor of future catch over large geographic areas (Shanks and Roegner, 2007).

Fishery closures to prevent interactions with SARA-listed species and to protect critical habitat are applied to all relevant fisheries and not specific to Halibut.","Over the past decade harvest rates have moved above and below the target harvest rate. It is important to distinguish between ""harvest rate"" which reflects the fraction of removals relative to the available biomass, and the harvest level, which does not have a clear definition but appears to refer to quota taken relative to the quota that was set. The harvest rate reference for BC is 21% and the harvest rate is estimated to have been above this rate for several years. This is due to a complex set of circumstances that include retrospective bias in the stock assessment model (i.e., the model downgrades its estimate of previous stock size every time a new year of data is added), and the decision-making process, which takes into account risk to the stock as well as social and economic risk.",,,

The DFO PA policy specifies that the default LRP and USR are 0.4 and 0.8 of Bmsy respectively (DFO 2009). In the case of Pink and Spiny scallops, there is a paucity of data on which to estimate Bmsy; however, average biomass over a productive period could be used as a proxy for Bmsy.

This mitigation measure is in place only for fixed-gear (longline) fishing, to minimize the risk of interactions with marine mammals such as right whales (a species listed under SARA). This measure is not in place for other gear.","The catch rate measured in weight, taken from the fishery data, indicates that the harvested component, mostly individuals between 85 cm and 110 cm, is at the highest level observed in the historical series (1997–2016). Although stable since 2013, this indicator has increased by an average of 12% per year since 1997. The exploitation rate for the harvested component, however, still remains unknown.
Fishery-independent surveys show that the total abundance of sub-legal size individuals is either stable or has increased since the beginning of the respective historical series. Cohort monitoring suggests that recruitment will be good over the coming years. The proportion of fish under the size of 85 cm caught in the commercial fishery, and possibly the mortality of this component, has decreased between 2007 and 2014, and is now around 40%.
Current approaches do not quantitatively or even qualitatively describe the levels and trends of the stock’s female reproductive component and, consequently, the stock’s reproductive potential. However, a growing number of individuals over 130 cm in the catches sampled at sea or dockside has been noted. It is impossible to determine whether this indicates an increase in the abundance of this component of the stock or a change in fishing behaviour.",,,

7.9 Rules for establishing TAC
The decision-making framework based on the precautionary approach includes annual TAC adjustment rules for each shrimp fishing zone. Decision rules were established based on the relationship observed between the main stock status indicator for one year and the harvest for the following year. This relationship was adjusted based on the classification of stock status zones to adjust the exploitation rate according to the resource’s status.
The decision rule is based on a stable exploitation rate when the stock is in the healthy zone, equal to the mean rate observed between 1990 and 2010. The removal rate decreases through the cautious and into the critical zone until it reaches a constant value corresponding to one-fourth of the rate in the healthy zone. The TAC for a given year is based on the main stock status indicator for the previous year and on its position in relation to the stock status classification zones (healthy, cautious and critical). To minimize TAC variations that may arise between two consecutive years, decision rules are completed using a formula that plans the application of a threshold and a cap on TAC changes. No adjustment will be made if the difference between the TAC and the projected harvest of two consecutive years is less than 5%. If the stock is in the healthy zone and the difference between the TAC and the projected harvest is more than 5%, a cap will be applied and the TAC adjustment (positive or negative) will not exceed 15%.",Harvest rate/level at or below removal reference,,,,No,,No,Yes,,Yes,No,,,,,Yes,Yes,Yes,,Yes,No,,,,,,,,,,It was determined in the IFMP that bycatch in the shrimp fishery is very low and its impact does not endanger non-target populations and does not prevent recovery of species at risk.,,,

The proposed limit reference point (LRP) and upper stock reference (USR) are 40% and 80%, respectively, of the spawning stock biomass (Bref) average of the survey estimated by the model. The Bref is estimated by the base OM from the biomass indicators of the Unit 1 survey and corresponds to the average biomass of 1984–1990 and 1984–1992 for S. mentella and S. fasciatus, respectively, divided by the respective catchability coefficient for each species estimated for Unit 1. The periods chosen for each species are considered productive periods according to the survey indicators. Umsy (exploitation rate at maximum sustainable yield) was also calculated for each species. The performance of the MPs was assessed against the reference points generated in each model, and the reference points were updated each year in the simulations.

In Unit 1, redfish conservation measures include the implementation of a protocol for protecting small fish (fish < 22 cm must make up less than 15% of catches, in number), 100% dockside monitoring, mandatory radio reports upon departure and arrival, imposition of a level of coverage by at-sea observers and the implementation of a bycatch protocol. Closure periods were also introduced, 1) to protect copulation (fall) and larval extrusion (spring) periods; 2) to minimize catches of Unit 1 redfish migrating in subdivision 3Pn4Vn in late fall and winter; and 3) to protect cod reproduction (division 4RS). In addition, since the index fishery was introduced in 1998, fishing is allowed only between longitudes 59° and 65° (W) at depths greater than 182 m (> 100 fathoms). An area has also been closed in NAFO division 4T since August 2009 to avoid incidental catches of Greenland halibut.

During the assessment of the management strategies for units 1 and 2 (2018), various management procedures were developed and tested. These procedures should make it possible to lift the moratorium in Unit 1 and to regulate commercial fishing of the stock in both units.
